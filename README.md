## A code that mimics docking windows like vb


</div>

### Description

As far as I know this only works in vb5 and above. I submited this code previously, but the link I provided was incorrect, and that fact has just now come to my attention, so I am now putting this back up. You can download it either from here or my site. Either is fine. To get it from my site go to

http://www.vbtutor.com/downloads/docking.zip

or just download it here.
