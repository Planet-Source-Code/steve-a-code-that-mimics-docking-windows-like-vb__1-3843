Docking Form Example Project
----------------------------

You are free to use this control and source code in any way you wish, 
entirely at your own risk.

Description
-----------
This project demonstrates a technique for simulating the 'drag and dock'
functionality of dialogs in the Visual Basic IDE using a UserControl that
simulates a form's caption bar.

This project also demonstrates a simple way to simulate splitter bar
functionality using the SendMessage API function to resize a PictureBox
and a method for keeping a form 'on top' of another form, but not above
windows external to the application.

Most of the functional code is contained in the UserControl and Form1.
